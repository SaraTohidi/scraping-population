# scraping-population

The worldmeters website provides up-to-date information.

The website approved by ALA (American Library Association). 

It runs by a team of developers, researchers and also volunteers. 

It also has been up to date for about 15 years.



Here, I am scraping their website to extract population data and transform it to dataframe.
